            <h3>How My Interests Connect to Computer Science</h3>
            <p>The strategy and thinking I use when playing games comes very handy when trying to code or tweak anything.
                 The creativity and the art within Anime will help me in styling or trying to come up with creative projects. The amount I try to improve technology will help me try hard and better to improve my coding skills. </p>
